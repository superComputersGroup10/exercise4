To run the code, it is now necessary to indicate the output file as a third parameter. Therefore, the code
should be run as:

mpirun -np <# proc> cannon <matrix A> <matrix B> <output file>

If the user wants to perform a serial checking, it is enough to add a fourth parameter, that can have
any value.

The code was compiled and tested with two different configurations:

    1) OpenMPI 2.0 with gcc 7
    2) mpi.ibm with intel 16.0
