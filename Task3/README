To run the code, it is now necessary to indicate the output file as a third parameter. Therefore, the code
should be run as:

mpirun -np <# proc> cannon <matrix A> <matrix B> <output file>

If the user wants to perform a serial checking, it is enough to add a fourth parameter, that can have
any value.

The code was succesfully compiled and tested with the following configuration: 

    1) mpi.ibm with intel 16.0
    
Some compilers as gcc 5.4.0 with OpenMPI 1.10 gave runtime errors.
